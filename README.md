There are three methods
method two() gets user input for a two by two integer 2d array, then prints the sum of row two and column two
method three() puts random numbers between 1-100 in a 4 by 5 integer 2d array, then prints the sum of the major diagonal
method four() calculates the number of negative numbers, positive numbers, and zeros in any given integer 2d array
